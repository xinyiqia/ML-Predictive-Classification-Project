# ML-Predictive-Classification-Project
Spring 2019 4243 APPLIED DATA SCIENCE Midterm Project 

Sources of Data: The MNIST Fashion database (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) collected a large number of images for different types of apparel. Each image is divided into small squares called pixels of equal area. Within each pixel, a brightness measurement was recorded in grayscale. The brightness values range from 0 (white) to 255 (black). The original data set divided each image into 784 (28 by 28) pixels. 

Project Objective: Our goal is to construct a variety of machine learning models with the goal of generating predictive classification. Specifically, we are trying to identify the types of apparel by using pixel records. 

Use of Analytical Techniques:
1. multinomial logistic 
2. k nearest neighbors
3. classification tree
3. random forest
4. boosting
5. SVM 
6. an ensembling model that take the prediction outcome from 3 models.
